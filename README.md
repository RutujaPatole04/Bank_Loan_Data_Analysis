# Bank_Loan_Data_Analysis
I recently completed a bank loan report analysis using SQL and Power BI. 

Key highlights:

📊 Dashboards Created:

3 dashboards created: Summary, Overview and Details

KPI Report: Tracked total loan applications, funded amounts, received amounts, interest rates, and DTI.

Interactive Filters: Included filters for years, loan terms, and home ownership.

Detailed Data View: Provided granular data set view.

🛠 Tools & Steps:

SQL: Imported data, created databases, and compared queries with dashboard charts.

Power BI: Transferred data from MS SQL to Power BI, created a date table, and set up time-based analysis.

📈 Metrics Tracked:

Total Loan Applications, Funded Amount, Amount Received

Average Interest Rate, Average DTI, Good vs. Bad Loans

🔍 Interactive Visuals: Used slicers for state, grade, and purpose. Created sortable charts by month.
